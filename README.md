https-proxy
===========

By RÃ©mino Rem <https://remino.net>

A dumb HTTPS proxy that generates a self-signed certificate on startup.

Useful when having to troubleshoot a page on localhost via HTTPS, as many modern JavaScript APIs will not be functional unless the page is on localhost or accessed via HTTPS.
